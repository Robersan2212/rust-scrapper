# Overview
As a Software Engineer, I intend to learn low-level programming, and a viable way I found was through the Rust programming language. This software is a web scraping tool that uses CSS selectors to scrape data and save it to a CSV file. This program was useful for learning the principles of Rust such as: variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, and functions. I intend to scale this scraper for JavaScript-heavy websites.
